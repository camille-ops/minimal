## Message for you

My name is Camille / Kaye. I love automating things and I am currently improving my embedded software skills (**C, C++ and Linux**). I was in IT Support and I love it, I like everything about technology. My goal is to become an Embedded Software Engineer, where I can demonstrate my skills, so welcome to my portfolio website, and see the things that I'm working on, I can't wait to talk to you about it. Please find my resume on the left side of the page.
