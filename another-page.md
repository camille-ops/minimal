## Message for you

My name is Camille / Kaye. I love automating things and I am currently learning about embedded software (C, C++ and Linux). I was in IT Support previously and I love it, I like everything about technology. My goal is to become an Embedded Software Engineer, where I can demonstrate and improve my skills, so welcome to my portfolio website, and see the things that I'm working on, I can't wait to talk to you about it. Please find my resume on the left side of the page.

a personal project that I worked on in University where I was lazy to write a 5000 word essay for the career seminars that I attended. I found a way automate it  by scanning my handwriting on _Calligraphr_ and made it as a font for Microsoft Word (ttf). I then use **VBA** script in Word to randomize each letter's font based on the multiple handwriting fonts that I uploaded.

I am still discovering what else I can automate now.
