## Message for you

My name is Camille / Kaye. I love automating things and I am currently improving my embedded software skills (**C, C++ and Linux**). I was in IT Support and I love it, I like everything about technology. My goal is to become an Embedded Software Engineer, where I can demonstrate my skills, so welcome to my portfolio website, and see the things that I'm working on, I can't wait to talk to you about it. Please find my resume on the left side of the page.

~~I discovered my interest for software in a personal project while I was in University. I was lazy to write a 5000 word essay for the career seminars that I attended. I found a way automate it by scanning my handwriting on _Calligraphr_ and made it as a font for Microsoft Word (ttf). I then use **VBA** script in Word to randomize each letter's font based on the multiple handwriting fonts that I uploaded. I also discovered embedded software engineering, combining electronics with software during this time.~~
